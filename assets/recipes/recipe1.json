	"articleBody":"From Amisha Dodhia Gurbani's debut cookbook, Mumbai Modern, this tart captures the flavors and flakiness of a samosa with none of the deep-frying, making it a party-ready appetizer that is as crowd-pleasing as it is low-lift. According to her, the Fontina layer is crucial: “Fontina’s a really wonderful cheese and quite underrated, in my opinion—and it goes so well with spicy flavors.” For an even faster turnaround, boil the potatoes the day before and keep them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to build the tart.",
