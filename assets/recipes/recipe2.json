	"description":"America can\u2019t seem to get enough of shrimp scampi: It\u2019s one of the 10 most-searched recipes on FoodNetwork.com during the summer (more popular than burgers!) and #shrimpscampi has more than 134,000 posts on Instagram. What\u2019s the excitement all about? Do we love shrimp scampi because it\u2019s simple but seemingly fancy? Or because it\u2019s done in 30 minutes? Or because we just can\u2019t resist a buttery wine sauce? All of the above!",

Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is just golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until pink and just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the shrimp to a plate. Add the wine and lemon juice to the skillet and simmer until slightly reduced, 2 minutes. "

Continue to cook, tossing, until the butter is melted and the shrimp is hot, about 2 minutes, adding more of the reserved cooking water as needed. Season with salt; stir in the parsley. Serve with lemon wedges. "

		  "reviewBody":"It was Friday night and hubby and I didn\u2019t have a dinner plan in place and the time was marching on. Needed something fast and easy.  Found this Classic Shrimp Scampi recipe and decided to try it out. Was delicious and simple to make. Made a couple of enhancements. After simmering the shrimp as instructed and removing from pan, I pulled the shells off and toasted the shells in the pan until nicely browned, then added the stock back in for a shrimp flavor bomb!  I also added the zest of the lemon I had squeezed to the sauce because - hey, who doesn\u2019t want more lemon flavor in this and it would be a crime to leave it behind.  I strained out the sediments, added sauce back to the pan and followed the recipe as written.  Oh yes, in case you run low on fettuccine like we were, I added Thai noodles to augment my starch. It gave the pasta water great flavor and you couldn\u2019t discern the difference between the noodles in the finished dish.  Was a good augment. We loved this dish and will make again!",
